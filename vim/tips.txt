'. will take you to the place where last some editing was done in a file

Typing two backquotes (` `) returns you to your original position (the position where you issued the last G command), unless you have done some edits in the meantime. If you have made an edit, and then moved the cursor using some command other than G, ` ` will return the cursor to the site of your last edit. If you have issued a search command (/ or ?), ` ` will return the cursor to its position when you started the search. A pair of apostrophes (' ') works much like two backquotes, except that it returns the cursor to the beginning of the line instead of the exact position on that line where your cursor had been.

dfx deletes up to and including the named character x. This command is useful in deleting or yanking partial lines. You might need to use dfx instead of dw if there were symbols or punctuation within the line that made counting words difficult. The t command works just like f, except that it positions the cursor before the character searched for. For example, the command ct. could be used to change text up to the end of a sentence, leaving the period.


The command fx moves the cursor to the next instance of the character x (where x stands for any character). The command tx moves the cursor to the character before the next instance of x. Semicolons can then be used repeatedly to "find" your way along.The command fx moves the cursor to the next instance of the character x (where x stands for any character).
